# Enrollment Ratios
I was curious if there was low enrollment this semester.
Thus I collected all the enrollment information for classes in the CS 
department on 2021-12-08.
Note that some of the courses have more than maximum enrollment, that is
not a clerical error.
Also, note that I did not include self study, research, thesis courses as
those are dependent on an individual student's career and are not canceled
from low enrollment.
I did include Senior Design and graduate seminars though, as those are 
required for enrollment.


Over all, it seems like enrollment is as to be expected.
There is high undergrad enrollment, with the median at ~83%.
The grad enrollment is lower, with the median at ~63%, but every semester
there are complaints that graduate courses don't get enough enrollment to
not be cancelled.
The overall enrolment is at about ~83%, which is because most of the
graduate courses are actually combined courses with undergrads.
There are little graduate exclusive courses compared to undergraduate 
  exclusive courses.

Note, I did not take the time to collect data from the fall semester.
